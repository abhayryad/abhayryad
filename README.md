# 👋 Hey, I'm Abhay Yadav

I'm a developer focused on building **minimal**, **utility-driven** apps with clean design and actual usefulness. Whether it's debugging APIs, tracking moods, or chatting smarter — I like building tools that *just work*.

### 🚀 Projects I'm Crafting

#### 🔧 PocketAPI
A lightweight Postman alternative for mobile. Test APIs quickly, manage requests with headers/body/params/auth, and view clean responses — all from your phone.

#### 📔 Emolog
A mood journal that lets you track emotions with emojis, visualize mood trends over time, and reflect — simple, aesthetic, and insightful.

#### 💬 SynLink *(WIP)*
A modern chat app built in Flutter, focused on **fast, private, and intuitive** messaging. Minimal UI, strong performance, and flexible features:
- Realtime messaging (via Firebase)
- Conversations, friend requests, status indicators
- Scalable design with clean architecture
- Future scope: Media sharing, themes, end-to-end encryption

#### 🧠 AI + Flutter Experiments
Working on practical AI features for mobile — like auto-tagging emotions in journals, summarizing conversations, and smart notifications.
